These are a selection of workflows for [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) aimed at helping CNC, laser and possibly Eufymake work that utilise depth maps for various makery tasks.

| LaserDepth Extract Subject Generative Background Upscale.json | Automatically extracts subjects from a given image. Creates separate prompt driven background image. Creates separate depth maps of each and merges them into one depth map, and creates a merged normal image. Both resulting output images are upscaled by 4x. |
